Hi! This is the first post, and also first test to see if it works.

This is a new blog I built for my girlfriend. It runs on Jekyll on GitHub Pages, and is managed using the Siteleaf developer plan. This setup gives us exact control over the HTML that is being generated, and allows us to build a quick and responsive site using semantic HTML.

It also gives my girlfriend the ability to manage the blog herself with ease through the Siteleaf UI. And best of all: it's all free, and every component (source hosting, static hosting, CMS) can be easily swapped later.

Yay!
